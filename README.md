# 14 - Inheritance (Lesson)

###### ICS4U - Mr. Brash üêø

Humans have legs and whales don't... But we both breathe air with lungs. We _inherit_ the trait "lungs" from the mammal _classification_.

The same can be done with objects (classes) in OOP.

# Part 1 - Inheritance

Protection is very important. It is a cornerstone of OOP. But what if we end up with multiple Classes that contain similar code?

---

When _designing_ an object, you might realize that it requires some or all of the same code as another object you already declared. An important idiom of programming is **DRY** - **D**on't **R**epeat **Y**ourself. If you can reuse part of another object, you might want to do so.

Let's use real life **animals** as an example:

![](assets/inheritance_small.png)

All of the animals listed above have ears. They eat. They make noise. They are warm-blooded. But they are different - they make _different_ noises, they eat different foods. They may or may not have fur. What if we included a bird or human?

When declaring classes for these "objects", we might use the following:
![animals](assets/animals.png)

Notice the arrows from each `subclass` to the `Animal` `superclass`? This means "Dog comes from Animal", etc. All three subclasses have the traits of `Animal`.

In this example, the `Dog` class _extends_ the `Animal` class but adds a few things. Similarly, the `Cat` and `Cow` classes also _extend_ the `Animal` class. They _inherit_ the values and methods from the `Animal` class and have the opportunity to add their own.

**Let's look at a simplified example in JavaScript:**
```JS
// The superclass (parent)
class Animal {
  legs = 2;

  constructor(legs) {
    this.legs = legs;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log("I'm an Animal");
  }
}

// A subclass (child) of Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  name = "";
  has_fleas = false;

  constructor(name, fleas) {
    this.legs = 4;      // We still have a "legs" attribute
    this.name = name;
    this.has_fleas = fleas;
  }

  // Override the speak() function
  speak() {
    console.log("WOOF!");
  }  
}
```

ü§î Should the number `legs` be public (editable)? (more on that later)

### Notice the keyword `extends` on the `Dog` class.
This means the `Dog` class will _inherit_ everything already created inside the `Animal` class. We can choose to keep it all or overwrite some of it - like overwriting the `speak()` method.

Let's test instances of a generic `Animal` or a `Dog`:
```JS
let anim = new Animal(6);
let doggo = new Dog("Spot", false);

anim.speak();   // "I'm an Animal"
doggo.speak();  // "WOOF!"
anim.legs       // 6
doggo.legs      // 4
anim.has_fleas  // undefined
doggo.has_fleas // false
anim.name       // undefined
doggo.name      // "Spot"
```

### ‚ùîQuestion:
Can you think of some `subclasses` that would inherit from and _extend_ the `Vehicle` class you created last class?

<br><br>

# Part 2 - Super! ü¶∏üèª

Let's go back to the `legs` property of our example above. Once an animal is defined and declared, the number of legs should not be editable. For example, the _definition_ of a human is to have 2 legs and a spider is to have 8.

The easy fix is to make `legs` private and add a `get` so it becomes protected:

```JS
// The superclass (parent)
class Animal {
  #legs = 2;

  constructor(legs) {
    this.#legs = legs;
  }

  speak() {
    console.log("I'm an Animal");
  }

  get legs() {
    return this.#legs;
  }
}
```

But that creates a new problem (because of course it does). The `Dog` class, which extends `Animal` can no longer _modify_ the `legs` variable! It's _**protected**_.

ü¶∏üèª In order to set the legs during instantiation, we need to call the _constructor_ of the **Superclass**. The keyword `super` allows us to utilize methods of the parent class.

```JS
// The subclass (child) of Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
  name = "";
  has_fleas = false;

  constructor(name, fleas) {
    super(4);               // <-- call the constructor of Animal! ü¶∏üèª
    this.name = name;
    this.has_fleas = fleas;
  }

  // Override the speak() function
  speak() {
    console.log("WOOF!");
  }  
}
```

In that example, the keyword `super(4)` is taking the place of the `Animal` constructor. It's like calling `new Animal(4)` while we setup the `Dog`.

There's one more use of the `super` keyword. Remember the `speak()` function? We overwrote the method in the subclass, so we have two versions:
```JS
// Inside Animal:
speak() {
  console.log("I'm an Animal");
}

// Inside Dog:
speak() {
  console.log("WOOF!");
}
```

What if, for some reason, we wanted to call the `speak()` function of the **superclass**? Perhaps we create a "What are you?" method inside `Dog` or similar... 

```JS
// Inside Dog:
speak() {
  super.speak();
  console.log("WOOF!");
}
```

Now if we ask a `Dog` object to `speak()` the output will be:
```Text
I'm an Animal
WOOF!
```

### ü§î Why is that useful?
Perhaps we want to run the superclass method and modify it just a bit. Take a bank account transaction fee as an example. In a normal, no-fee savings account you can credit or debit your account and you aren't charged a fee. However, in a chequing (checking) account you are charged a small fee per transaction. Both account types would need `credit()` and `debit()` methods but the checking account would need to reduce your balance by just a bit each time.

Similarly, some accounts charge for money conversions, transactions from cash machines, or e-transfers.

Each account type could _inherit_ from a parent `Account` class and utilize the parent `super.debit()` and `super.credit()` methods but modify the balance during the transaction.
